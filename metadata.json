  "long_description": "# Symantec\n\nInstalls Symantec Endpoint Protection from internal package repository.\n\n## Description\n\nHas been tested on Windows Server 2008.  Should work on other Windows family platforms.\n\n## Requirements\n\nYou must set up an internal package repository to distribute Symantec by HTTP.\n\nThe recipe looks for the Setup file at http://yum.($domain)/symantec/symantec-($kernel.machine)-setup.exe, by default.\n\n## Attributes\n\n* `symantec['appid']` - Used to build the uninstall command\n* `symantec['install_source']` - Internal http repository with Symantec binary\n* `symantec['install_options']` - Defaults to silent mode, with LiveUpdate, and no reboot\n\n## Usage\n\n### Install Symantec\n\nAdd symantec::default to your `run_list`.  The recipe will remove itself\nfrom the `run_list` after the first successful run.  Symantec has done\na nice job creating a non-standard MSI package which is not particularly\neasy to automate by resource.  This was the only way which I could guard the\nrecipe with idempotent installation behavior.\n\n### Uninstall Symantec\n\nAdd symantec::undo to your `run_list`.  The recipe will remove itself\nfrom the `run_list` after Symantec has been uninstalled.  The recipe\nalso requests a reboot, upon successful execution.  See the `windows_reboot`\ndocumentation accompanying the Opscode [windows](http://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/windows)\ncookbook, to disable the `windows_reboot` handler.\n\n## License and Author\n\nAuthor: Eric G.
